R package for Genomic Selection with Genotyping-by-Sequencing

This package provides three functions:

GBSPipeline, A function for running the de novo Genotypine-by-Sequencing pipeline described by Poland et al. (2012). A copy of Tassel 4.0 and Java 1.7 is required to use this function. Tassel 4.0 can be obtained here: http://tassel.bitbucket.org/TasselArchived.html 

hap2marker, A function for converting .hap generated by GBSPipeline into a numeric matrix suitable for building genomic selection models using several methods.

GS.model, A wrapper function for calculating genomic selection prediction using several methods found in other R packages.

The package can be installed in R if the 'devtools' package is installed. Simply load the 'devtools' package and enter the following in R: install_github("gaynorr/GSwGBS")
